Global optimization has gained attraction over the past decades, thanks to the development of both theoretical foundations and efficient numerical routines to cope with optimization problems of various complexities. Among recent methods, Kernel Sum of Squares (KernelSOS) appears as a powerful framework, leveraging the potential of sum of squares methods from the polynomial optimization community with the expressivity of kernel methods widely used in machine learning. This paper applies the kernel sum of squares framework for solving control and estimation problems, which exhibit poor local minima. We demonstrate that KernelSOS performs well on a selection of problems from both domains. In particular, we show that KernelSOS is competitive with other sum of squares approaches on estimation problems, while being applicable to non-polynomial and non-parametric formulations. The sample-based nature of KernelSOS allows us to apply it to trajectory optimization problems with an integrated simulator treated as a black box, both as a standalone method and as a powerful initialization method for local solvers, facilitating the discovery of better solutions.
