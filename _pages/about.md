I am a first-year Ph.D. student affiliated with both the [WILLOW](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/) project team at Inria Paris (Department of Computer Science at École Normale Supérieure de Paris) and [ISIR](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/isir/presentation/?lang=en) (Sorbonne University/CNRS), under the supervision of [Justin Carpentier](https://jcarpent.github.io) and [Nicolas Perrin-Gilbert](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/personnel/perrin/?lang=en). 

As a Ph.D. student in robotics, I focus on improving robots' agility and dexterity through the integration of optimal control and reinforcement learning. This involves designing algorithms for efficient control and optimization, and exploring their theoretical foundations and real-world applications. My goal is to advance the field of robotics and find new solutions to its challenges.

Prior to my Ph.D., I gained experience as a research engineer at Wandercraft, where I used RL solutions to control a self-balanced exoskeleton, and at Inria, where I developed new features for [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) and [Proxsuite](https://github.com/simple-robotics/proxsuite). I hold a master's degree in Robotics, Cognition and Intelligence from Technical University Munich (TUM), which I obtained with distinction in January 2021. During my studies, I worked on machine learning for robotics projects in leading research labs in Germany and Japan under the supervision of [Prof. Laura Leal-Taixé](https://dvl.in.tum.de/team/lealtaixe/) and [Prof. Yoshihiko Nakamura](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gkFd-RcAAAAJ&hl=en).
