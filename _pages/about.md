I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [WILLOW](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/) team at Inria Paris (Department of Computer Science at École Normale Supérieure de Paris), under the supervision of [Justin Carpentier](https://jcarpent.github.io) (Inria & ENS Paris) and [Nicolas Perrin-Gilbert](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/personnel/perrin/?lang=en) ([ISIR](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/isir/presentation/?lang=en) at Sorbonne University). 

As a Ph.D. student in robotics, I focus on improving robots' agility and dexterity through the integration of optimal control and reinforcement learning. My research explores sampling-based optimization methods enhanced with gradient information and expressive policy representations such as flow-matching. This involves designing algorithms for efficient control and optimization, and exploring their theoretical foundations and real-world applications.

Prior to my Ph.D., I gained experience as a research engineer at Wandercraft, where I used RL solutions to control a self-balanced exoskeleton, and at Inria, where I developed new features for [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) and [Proxsuite](https://github.com/simple-robotics/proxsuite). I hold a master's degree in Robotics, Cognition and Intelligence from Technical University Munich (TUM), which I obtained with distinction in January 2021. During my studies, I worked on machine learning for robotics projects in leading research labs in Germany and Japan under the supervision of [Prof. Laura Leal-Taixé](https://dvl.in.tum.de/team/lealtaixe/) and [Prof. Yoshihiko Nakamura](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gkFd-RcAAAAJ&hl=en).
